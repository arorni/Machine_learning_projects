#NYC Taxi Fare Prediction

This project tries to predict taxi fares in New York region using a machine learning model. The dataset includes details such as pickup and drop-off locations, date and time, passenger count, and distance traveled. The goal is to build a machine learning model that can provide a reasonable estimates for the taxi fares based on these features.

I used Python for data processing, feature engineering, and model training, leveraging XGBoost. Evaluation metrics include RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) and R2 score to assess model performance.

## Lessons Learned
As generally said in the data community, a good project is defined by the decisions you take and the understanding you build during the project. Below are some of the lessons I learned:

- The dataset was massive (approx. 55 million rows), and managing it on my 8GB RAM, Intel i5 laptop posed challenges. Efficient data ingestion and processing were critical. 
- I had used vaex to ingest the entire training dataset in just 18 secs. During the project, I faced and overcame library incompatibility issues when changing laptops, emphasizing the importance of tracking library versions.
- Decisions such as how much data would be enough for my use case? How much data should I use for EDA (Used radom sampling technique) were crucial?
- I got an opportunity to learn about the Geopandas and Geopy libraries.

Note: For my project, I have used train.csv and worked on 2014 and 2015 data. Please feel free to explore and play with the entire dataset.
